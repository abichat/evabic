**evabic** aims to **eva**luate **bi**nary **c**lassifiers by specifying what is detected as true and what is actually true. It has no dependencies.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("abichat/evabic")
```

## Measures

__evabic__ provides handy functions to compute `r length(evabic::ebc_allmeasures)` different measures. Each function begins with `ebc_*`.

Available measures include True Positive Rate (Sensitivity or Recall), True Negative Rate (Specificity), Positive Predictive Value (Precision), False Discovery Rate, Accuracy, F1... 

```{r allmeasures}
evabic::ebc_allmeasures
```

All measures are computed from the confusion matrix:

## Example

Let's use **evabic** on a toy example. 

```{r package}
library(evabic)
```

Consider three variables `X1`, `X2` and `X3`, `Y` a variable predicted by this three variables, and 4 more conditionally independent variables `X4` to `X7`. 

```{r data}
set.seed(42)
X1 <- rnorm(50)
X2 <- rnorm(50)
X3 <- rnorm(50)
predictors <- paste0("X", 1:3)

df_lm <- data.frame(X1 = X1, X2 = X2, X3 = X3, 
                    X4 = X1 + X2 + X3 + rnorm(50, sd = 0.5),
                    X5 = X1 + 3 * X3 + rnorm(50, sd = 0.5),
                    X6 = X2 - 2 * X3 + rnorm(50, sd = 0.5),
                    X7 = X1 - 0.2 * X2 + rnorm(50, sd = 2),
                    Y  = X1 - 0.2 * X2 + 3 * X3 + rnorm(50))
```

We use a linear regression to detect the actual predictors (do not select significant variables like this at home, it's a bad way to do so).

```{r model}
model <- lm(Y ~ ., data = df_lm)
summary(model)
pvalues <- summary(model)$coefficients[-1, 4]
pvalues
detected_var <- names(pvalues[pvalues < 0.05])
detected_var
```

Here, we selected two predictors among the three true predictors.

Single measures are available with `ebc_*()` functions. 

```{r measures}
ebc_TPR(detected = detected_var, true = predictors)
ebc_ACC(detected = detected_var, true = predictors, m = 7) # the total size of the set is 7
```

You can also ask for several measures in a single row summary format with `ebc_tidy()`.

```{r tidy}
ebc_tidy(detected = detected_var, true = predictors, m = 7, 
         # you can use `measures = ebc_allmeasures` to compute all measures
         measures = c("TPR", "TNR", "FDR", "ACC", "BACC", "F1")) 
```

Note that **evabic** also supports named logicals for `detected` and `true` arguments, but they must be named (see the `add_names()` function if needed).

```{r logical}
pvalues < 0.05
ebc_tidy(detected = pvalues < 0.05, true = predictors, m = 7, 
         measures = c("TPR", "TNR", "FDR", "ACC", "BACC", "F1"))
```

With `ebc_tidy_by_threshold()`, you can ask for the evolution of measures according to a moving threshold if you provide the vector of p-values (or any score).

```{r tidy-by-threshold}
df_measures <- ebc_tidy_by_threshold(detection_values = pvalues, true = predictors, m = 7, 
                                     measures = c("TPR", "FPR", "FDR", "ACC", "BACC", "F1"))
df_measures
```

This makes it easy to plot various-threshold curves like ROC curve.

```{r roc}
plot(df_measures$FPR, df_measures$TPR, type = "b", xlab = "FPR", ylab = "TPR")
```

And finally, you can ask for the AUC, the area under the ROC curve.

```{r auc}
ebc_AUC(detection_values = pvalues, true = predictors, m = 7)
ebc_AUC_from_measures(df_measures)
```
